Version 2.0 7/29/2013

This directory contains a skeleton for CS61B Project 2.

Although some of what's in here might seem mysterious to you, try to 
understand what it's all for.  Don't be afraid to ask us about it.

GENERAL NOTE:  EVERYTHING in these files is changeable as you see fit, unless
   otherwise noted.  Your task is to conform to the spec, period.  While
   we have suggested, with these files, certain points about the design, we
   don't require any of it.  

CONTENTS:

README                  This file.  You need not turn this in.
        
Makefile                For those of you using the standard Unix tool chain
                        rather than Eclipse, this file provides for some
                        simple compilation/testing control.  See the 
                        comments in it for the targets provided.  Those of
                        you using Eclipse won't need it.
