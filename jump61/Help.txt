You are playing jump61. 

clear:	:	Abandons the current game (if one is in progress), and clears the board to its initial
				configuration (all squares neutral). Playing stops until the next start command.
start 	:	Start playing from the current position, if not doing so already has no effect if currently
				playing). Takes moves alternately from Player 1 and Player 2 according to their color
				and the current move number.Project #2: Jumping Cubes 3
				quit Exits the program.
red 	:	Cause Player 1 to play red and Player 2 to play blue on subsequent moves.
blue 	:	Cause Player 1 to play blue and Player 2 to play red on subsequent moves.
auto N 	:	Stops the current game until the next start command and causes Player N to be
				played by an automated player (an AI) on subsequent moves. The value N must be 1
				or 2.
manual N :	Stops the current game until the next start command and causes Player N to
				take moves from the terminal on subsequent moves. The value of N must be 1 or 2.
size N 	:	Stops any current game, clears the board to its initial configuration, and sets the
				size of the board to N squares. Initially, N = 6.
moves N :	Stop any current game, set the total number of moves made to N. The first move
				is number 1. You usually use this command after setting up an initial position (with
				set commands.)
set 
R C N P :	Stop any current game. Put N spots at row R and column C (see ยง3.1). P
				is either b or r (for blue or red,) indicating the color of the square. When N is 0
				(which clears the square), P is ignored and the square is cleared. ยก
dump 	:	This command is especially for testing and debugging. It prints the board out in exactly
				the following format:
					===
					2r -- 2r 2r -- 2b
					-- -- 2r -- 3r --
					2r 3r 2r 3r -- 2b
					3r 1r 3r 2r 2r 2b
					2b 4r 3r 1r 3r 2b
					2b 2b 3b 2r 3b 1b
					===
				Here, -- indicates a neutral square, Nr indicates a red square with N spots, and
				Nb indicates a blue square with N spots. Dont use the two === markers anywhere
				else in your output. This gives the autograder a way to determine the state of your
				game board at any point. It does not change any of the state of the program. The lines
				other than the markers are indented.
seed N 		:	If your programs automated players use pseudo-random numbers to choose moves,
				this command sets the random seed to N (a long integer). This command has no effect
				if there is no random component to your automated players (or if you dont use them in
				a particular game). It doesnt matter exactly how you use N as long as your automated
				player behaves identically each time it is seeded with N. In the absence of a seed
				command, you do what you want to seed your generator.
